  **USING THE GRID SYSTEM IN TKINTER**:

This organizes widgets in a table-like structure.

| ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî | Column 0 | Column 1  | Column 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Row 0 | r0, c0 | r0, c1 | r0, c2 |
| Row 1 | r1,c0 | r1, c1 | r1, c2 |
| Row 2 | r2, c0 | r2, c1 | r2, c2 |

**Columnspan**: This allows your widget to take up more than one column.

```python
window = Tk()

firstnamelabel = Label(window, text='First Name', fg='red').grid(row=0, column=0)
firstname = Entry(window, borderwidth=9).grid(row=0, column=1)

lastnamelabel = Label(window, text='Last Name', fg='red').grid(row=1, column=0)
lastname = Entry(window, borderwidth=9,).grid(row=1, column=1)

emaillabel = Label(window, text='Email', fg='red').grid(row=2, column=0)
email = Entry(window, borderwidth=9).grid(row=2, column=1)

submitbtn = Button(window, text='submit here', fg='green', bg='black',activeforeground='green', activebackground='yellow' ).grid(row=3, column=1)

window.mainloop()


**KEYBOARD EVENTS:**

We can bind a key event and function to a window or widget.

This is done using the bind( ) function

 

### bind( ):

 This function takes two parameters namely the event and a function

```python
window = Tk()

def doSomething(event):
    print("you did a thing")

window.bind("<Return>", doSomething)

window.mainloop()

```

**NB**: The function being called must have one parameter which is ‚Äúevent‚Äù

**NB**: To apply the function to all keys, you use ‚Äú<Key>‚Äù

```python
window = Tk()
def dosomething(event):
    label.config(text=event.keysym)

window.bind("<Key>",dosomething)

label = Label(window,
              font=('Arial', 100))

label.pack()
window.mainloop()
```

**MOUSE EVENTS:**

Mouse events are similar to keyboard events the only difference is that the events are caused by the clicking of the mouse

```python
windows = Tk()

def dosomething(event):
    print("you did this!!!")

windows.bind("<Button-1>", dosomething) #left mouse click
windows.bind("<Button-3>", dosomething) #right mouse click
windows.bind("<Button-2>", dosomething) #scroll wheel click

windows.mainloop()
```

Other mouse bindings include:

- **<‚ÄùButtonRelease‚Äù>** : **This triggers the event upon the release of the button.**
- **<‚ÄùEnter‚Äù> : This triggers the event as soon as the cursor enters the window.**
- **<‚Äùmotion‚Äù> : This triggers the event as long as the mouse is in motion.**
