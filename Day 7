BUTTONS:
These are your average buttons in TKinter.

Functions can also be attached to the buttons by use of the command option 

```python
mybutton = Button(window,
                  text="click me!!",
                  bg='dark green',
                  fg='white',
                  command=myclick(),
                  state=DISABLED)

mybutton.pack()
```

**NB**: when calling functions in command, donâ€™t put the parentheses. 

### INPUT FIELDS:

These allow you to enter text.

```python
def myclick():
    hello = "Hello "+ e.get()
    mylabel = Label(window, text=hello)
    mylabel.pack()

e = Entry(window,
          width=50,
          name="name",
          relief=RAISED,
          )
e.pack()
```

Retrieving text from the input fields can be done with the help of the .get() method.
