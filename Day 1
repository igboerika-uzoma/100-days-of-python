DAY 1      

## FUNCTIONS AND BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS:

Function = a block of code which is executed only when it is called

1. def keyword
2. function name
3. parentheses and colon

example of a function that prints a given name parameter:

*def* hello(*name*):

    print("hello "+*name*) 

   print("have a nice day")hello("uzoma") 

### built-in functions:

1. abs = gives the absolute value of  numbers like (-9), (-100.98)
2. all() = this tells if all objects in an iterable are true
3. bin() = this gives the binary form of a given number
4. filter() = this filters through values in an iterable
    
    these are just a few of the in-built functions we have in python
    
    ### LAMBDAS:
    
    lambda functions can be thought of as disposable functions. They can have any number of arguments but only have one expression.
    
    syntax:
    
    lambda <arguments>: <expression> 
    
    ```jsx
    double = *lambda* x:x * 2
    ```
    
    ```jsx
    multiply = *lambda* x,y:x * y
    ```
    
    ```jsx
    full_name = *lambda* firstname, lastname:firstname+" "+lastname
    ```
    
    ```jsx
    age_check = *lambda* age: *True if* age >= 18 *else False*
    ```
