### **METHOD CHAINING**:

This is calling multiple methods sequentially on the same object. Each call performs an action on the object and returns self.

What this basically means is that the methods are chained when they are being called (altogether)

```python
class Car:
    color = None

class Motorcycle:
    color = None

def change_color(car,color):
    car.color = color

car_1 = Car()
car_2 = Car()
car_3 = Car()

motorcycle_1 = Motorcycle()

change_color(car_1, "red")
change_color(car_2, "green")
change_color(car_3, "black")
change_color(motorcycle_1, "violet")

print(car_1.color)
print(car_2.color)
print(car_3.color)

```
