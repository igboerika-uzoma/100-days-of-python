[EXERCISE 3]
"""Create a Python class called Employee to represent employees in a company. The class should have:

Instance variables to store the employee's name, salary, and employment year.
Methods to:
Initialize the employee with a given name, salary, and employment year.
Calculate the number of years the employee has been with the company (based on the current year).
Apply a salary raise by a certain percentage.
Print out the employee's information, including their name, current salary, and years of employment.
After defining the class, create a few instances of the Employee class and test its methods by calculating years of employment,
 applying salary raises, and printing out employee information."""
